  </a>
    <p>Ubisoft has opened up Phase 2 of Title Update 12 for The Division 2 on the PC Public Test Server until Wednesday, December 2. The new phase will bring about a number of changes, including buffing some weapons and addressing bugs. Check out the patch notes below.

      The PDR assault rifle saw a damage buff to make it a competitive option when stacked against other assault rifles. The Exotics Bighorn and Capacitor have had their magazines increased, while the Exotic Scorpio saw some PvE and PvP debuffs to the duration of its status effects.</p>

    <h2>Apex Legends Glitch Lets You Lob Vehicles Across The Map</h2>
    </a>
    <p>Apex Legends recently added a lot of new content to the game to accompany the launch of Season 7, including the gravity-defying new Legend Horizon and a fresh map in the airborne city of Olympus. While Olympus is certainly focused on verticality, players have figured out a new way to take advantage of the map's exclusive vehicles in the form of a glitch that launches them across the map.

      To be clear, this glitch seems to have dubious tactical value, since you have relatively little control of the Trident's direction and arc, and it's likely to shunt you off the map or out of the circle. Still, that hasn't stopped some players from making interesting plays using the glitch, particularly one crew who managed to launch themselves down one of the map's towers.</p>

    <h2>Flight Simulator's Next World Update Focuses On The UK</h2>
  </a>
    <p>Microsoft Flight Simulator developer Asobo Studios has revealed plans to tweak the United Kingdom in its next World Update for the flight sim. Japan was the first area to receive a new lick of paint back in September, while a number of new airports and points of interest were added to the USA earlier this week.

      In a recent Twitch stream, Asobo laid out its roadmap for future updates, and the UK is next on the list with World Update 3 due out on January 28. The British Isles are set to be spruced up now that the studio has a new set of data for England, Scotland, and Wales. There's no map information for Northern Ireland available just yet, but head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann says the entirety of Ireland will be updated at some point in the future.

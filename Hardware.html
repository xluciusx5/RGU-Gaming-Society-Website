    <h1>Intel Core I9-10900K</h1>
    <p class="SOETXT"> Intel‚Äôs eight-core Core i9-10900K comes with everything to satisfy enthusiasts, like more cores, higher frequencies, and performance-boosting Solder TIM. Those improvements make the chip the fastest mainstream processor on the market, but the $500 asking price relegates it to the most extreme performance enthusiasts. </p>
    <p>For: Gaming performance; Performance in both single- and multi-threaded workloads; Solder TIM</p>
      <p> Against: Price; Cooling requirements; Power consumption under heavy load</p>

    <h1>üåüNvidia Geforce RTX 3090 (Founder's Edition)üåü</h1>
    <p class="SOETXT"> The RTX 3090 is a beast of a graphics card, but it's not exactly intended to be used by gamers as it has a very high diminishing returns factor outside of creative workloads. The RTX 3090 comes with a dual-fan cooler that has white black fans with chrome centres, clean lines and takes it easy on the RGB by reusing the now decade old idea of green lighting of the logo.</p>

    <h1>Corsair HX 1200</h1>
    <p class="SOETXT"> This is another high-end Corsair PSU that, aside from great overall performance, also offers quiet operation (clearly indicated by the LAMBDA-A+ badge it carries). The collaboration between CWT and Corsair is paying off, and we appreciate that much attention is paid to the 5VSB circuit's efficiency. This doesn't seem to be as high of a priority to EVGA and Super Flower.</p>
    <p> For: Full power at 46¬∞C; Efficient;  Ripple suppression; Load regulation; 10-year warranty</p>
    <p>Against: OCP at 5VSB; Bulky ATX, EPS and PCIe cables</p>

    <h1>üèÜG.Skill Trident Z Royal RGB Gold DDR4üèÜ</h1>
    <p class="SOETXT">Trident Z Royal is the latest addition to the Trident Z flagship family and features a crown jewel design. Featuring 8 GB sticks, performance finds beauty running at 4266MHz with CL19-39. Meticulously crafted to display just the right amount of light refraction, the crystalline light bar scatters the RGB colors in a magnificent display of LED lighting. Mirroring the high-class light bar design, polished aluminum heatspreaders of gold or silver colors cools the memory modules in the award-winning classic Trident Z tri-fin design.</p>

    <h1>Intel Optane SSD 900P Series 480GB</h1>
    <p class="SOETXT">Spend it if you‚Äôve got it. The Intel Optane SSD 900P 480GB is the highest capacity available, but don't expect more performance than the 280GB drive. You get 200GB more storage, but unfortunately, you spend nearly enough to buy an additional 280GB model. The dollars don't always make sense, but the 480GB drive gets you a larger 3D XPoint storage device</p>
<p>For: Consistent performance; The fastest storage technology available; Highest 3D XPoint capacity available</p>
<p> Against: Higher price per gigabyte (lower value); No RGB :(</p>

    <h1>PlayStation 5</h1>
    <p class="SOETXT">The tower of power. The Sony PlayStation 5 is a powerful game console with an incredible controller and tons of potential. But it makes some noise and has a divisive design that‚Äôs far too large for some conventional entertainment spaces.</p>
<p> For: DualShock 5 controller offers sensory experience; Extremely fast load times;  Backwards compatibility with PlayStation 4; Launch library with strong exclusives</p>
<p> Against: Very large, divisive design;  Limited storage space; Fan sometimes makes high-pitched noise</p>

    <h1>AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</h1>
    <p class="SOETXT"> The AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT and Radeon RX 6800 have arrived, joining the ranks of the best graphics cards and making some headway into the top positions in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy. Nvidia has had a virtual stranglehold on the GPU market for cards priced $500 or more, going back to at least the GTX 700-series in 2013. That's left AMD to mostly compete in the high-end, mid-range, and budget GPU markets. "No longer!" says Team Red.</p>

    <h1>ü§©Apple M1 Chipü§©</h1>
    <p class="SOETXT"> Apple‚Äôs new in-house M1 chip is officially on the market. The first reviews and benchmarks are starting to pop up, so we‚Äôre gathering everything we know about it into one handy place, which we‚Äôll update as we learn more. The first computers with Apple's M1 chip are already up for purchase. To try it, you‚Äôre going to have to choose between one of the three new products that feature the chip: the new MacBook Air, the 13-inch MacBook Pro or the Mac Mini. Each comes with two configurations using the M1. The MacBook Pro also still has two Intel configurations on offer, and the Mac Mini has one Intel processor offering.

    <h1>MSI Registers Several GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GPUs</h1>
    <p class="SOETXT">MSI (via harukaze5719) has registered today multiple custom GeForce RTX 3060 Ti models with the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC). As always, we don't expect every single one from the EEC listing to hit the market, but it gives us a good sense of what's to come.

      The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is a rumored Ampere graphics card from Nvidia that reportedly arrives with 4,864 CUDA cores and 8GB of GDDR6 memory. The mid-range performer would fit right under the GeForce RTX 3070 in Nvidia's product stack. The performance gap might not be very substantial considering that the GeForce RTX 3070 only has 21% more CUDA cores than the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, and both seemingly feature an identical memory configuration.</p>

    <h1>USB 4</h1>
    <p class="SOETXT">Get ready for a whole new generation of USB. First announced in 2019, "USB4‚Äù (official spelling lacks a space, but we‚Äôre using one in this article to reflect the way readers search) is finally appearing in some shipping computers, including Apple's M1-based Macbooks and Mac Mini and laptops with Intel 11th Gen Tiger Lake laptops. You won't find many (or perhaps any) devices marketed as USB 4 right now, but a new generation of USB 4-powered peripherals is just around the corner. 

      USB 4 promises a host of benefits that include faster transfer speeds, better management of video bandwidth and optional compatibility with Thunderbolt 3.</p>

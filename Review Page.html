                <h2>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h2>
                <img src = "assets/images/sky-review.jpg" alt="Skyrim" width="350" height = "200">
                <p>"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" is one of the most <br> iconic games of the 21st century. Released on 11/11/11 <br> by Bethesda Softworks, it has become what many <br> people, myself included, perceive to be one of the best <br> RPGs ever made. Like any good RPG, the only thing <br> that connects every character you'll ever make is that <br> they got caught crossing the border. Outwith that, you <br> can go whatever direction you like. You could play as <br> Khajiit thief, an Orcish beserker or a Breton mage. <br> The main storyline, the Dark Brotherhood and the <br>Thieves Guild questlines are the best three in the <br> game. <br> <br> However, the College of Winterhold questline is <br> underwhelming - since you can complete the whole <br> thing only ever casting a single spell. Other issues <br> include quests, such as "Blood on the Ice", that can be <br> broken in such a way that it is impossible to complete <br> them. <br> <br> The soundtrack fits the game very well. It has a nice <br> mix of calm music to set the scene and intense music <br> for battles against dragons. <br> <br> Overall, I would give "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" <br> an 8/10.</p>

                <img src = "assets/images/r6s-review.jpg" alt="Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege" width="350" height="200">
                <p>Developed by Ubisoft Montreal, "Tom Clancy's <br> Rainbow Six Siege" is an online, first-person shooter <br> in which you take control of one of a plethora of <br> operators - each with their own unique weapons, <br> gadgets and special ability. The game is primarily 5v5 <br> PvP multiplayer with a one life per round system. The <br> game is best enjoyed playing with four other friends <br> due to the fact that communication is pivotal to <br> success. If you decide to search for a game on your <br> own, you'll be matched with four other random <br> players. <br> <br> The community can unfortunately be quite toxic, <br> with purposeful teamkilling and unprovoked <br> vote-kicking running rampant. While this does bring <br> my enjoyment of the game down, it isn't the fault of <br> the developers and they are trying their best to <br> address the issue. <br> <br> The game doesn't have a soundtrack in the <br> same way others do, so there's nothing to comment on. <br> <br> Overall, I would give "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six <br> Siege" a 7/10.</p>

                <h2>FIFA 21</h2>
                <img src = "assets/images/fifa21-review.jpg" alt="FIFA 21" width="350" height="200">
                <p>"FIFA 21" is this years installment of the FIFA game <br> series, released by EA Sports. Despite being mostly <br> the same as its predecessor, there are some noteable <br> changes; gameplay is faster this year, a much needed <br> upgrade on FIFA 20's often irritating slowness. <br> Overpowered skill moves, such as the La Croqueta, <br> have been dialed down and put at a more appropriate <br> level. A new feature called "agile dribbling has also <br> been introduced, which allows users to have more <br> control over their players in-game. <br> <br> FIFA 21 does unfortunately have it's flaws. The <br> community are fairly negative, with EA even having <br> to go as far as to remove "toxic celebrations", such as <br> "The Dab" and "Shushing", from the game entirely. <br> The game's most popular mode, "Ultimate Team", is <br> littered with microtransactions, with some countries <br> such as Belgium even going as far as to declare it <br> gambling. The released content is often lazy and <br> recycled, which causes it to often receive negative <br> feedback from the community. <br> <br> The game's soundtrack is made up of current songs, <br> which includes Aitch, Dua Lipa and Celeste, among <br> others. <br> <br> Overall, I would give "FIFA 21" a rather lackluster <br> 4/10.</p>

                <img src = "assets/images/mw-review.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: Modern Warfare" width="350" height="200">
                <p>"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare" is the 16th game in <br> the iconic "Call of Duty" franchise, and is a soft <br> reboot of the 2007 game "Call of Duty 4: Modern <br> Warfare". I started playing "Call of Duty" in 2010 <br> with "Call of Duty: Black Ops", purchasing the new <br> game every single year up until 2016's "Call of Duty: <br> Black Ops 3". I didn't like the futuristic direction the <br> games were going in and my love of the franchise <br> dwindled away. But "Modern Warfare" brought me <br> straight back to what playing "Call of Duty" was like <br> when I was younger - the fun and exciting campaign <br> experience coupled with the late nights into early <br> mornings of grinding multiplayer with friends to get a <br> golden camouflage for my weapon. <br> <br> The game does have some issues with hit-detection as <br> well as smoke grenades being client-side rather than <br> server-side, which are both big issues in a game where <br> firing the first shot drastically improves your chances <br> of surviving that specific gunfight. <br> <br> The soundtrack contains scores that make you feel like <br> you're in an action movie.

                <img src = "assets/images/ac2-review.jpg" alt="Assassin's Creed 2" width="350" height="200">
                <p>Released back in November of 2009, Assassin's Creed <br> 2 is one of my favourite games of all time. The <br> gameplay is still as fun as it was 11 years ago and the <br> story is exceptional. You experience Ezio's change <br> from a young and inexperienced man to someone who <br> is certainly worthy of being part of the Assassin <br> Brotherhood. The negative aspects of "Assassin's <br> Creed" (2007) have mostly been addressed and fixed <br> for the sequel. <br> <br> The game does however have some issues. The <br> rendering of the faces of some NPCs is prone to <br> breaking, sometimes meaning that the NPC's face is a <br> pair of floating eyes and a mouth. There are problems <br> with crashes too, although these have been mostly <br> eradicated though the release of it's remaster in <br> "Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection" (2016). <br> <br> The soundtrack, composed by Jesper Kyd, is, in my <br> opinion, one of the best videogame soundtracks ever <br> composed. Click the play button below to listen to <br> "Ezio's Family", one of the most recognizable pieces <br> of video game music: <br> <audio id="soundtrack" controls><source src="assets/images/ac2-st.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support audio elements.

                <p>With over 200 million sales, Minecraft is the best <br> selling videogame of all time. It has a very simple <br> concept and, despite children being the target <br> audience, it is popular among all ages. The game is <br> still receiving updates nine years after its original <br> release, adding more possibilities to a world where <br> there was already an infinite amount of them. In <br> "Minecraft", there is quite literally no limit to what <br> you can do. In the past, players have created 1:1 scale <br> versions of New York City, built working aeroplanes, <br> and even a working computer with RAM! <br> <br> "Minecraft honestly doesn't have many negative <br> aspects at all. A very minor issue is that occassionally <br> while following you, both hostile and passive mobs <br> will lose interest before they should or they'll get <br> stuck on a block and are unable to navigate it. Other <br> than that, I would go as far as to say the game is <br> flawless. <br> <br> While the soundtrack isn't as intertwined with your <br> experience, it gives some soothing, ambient <br> background music while you are playing.

                <img src = "assets/images/amgus-review.jpg" alt="Among Us" width="350" height="200">
                <p>Despite being released in June of 2018, "Among Us" <br> only recently shot into the spotlight. Innersloth, the <br> developers of the game, announced the end of the <br> game's lifecycle in Januray 2020. But over two years <br> after initial release, the game unexpectedly began to <br> grow in popularity, after being livestreamed by some <br> fairly large content creators on Twitch. The game's <br> sequel was abandoned with the developers choosing to <br> put their time and effort into the current game. The <br> premise is simple: of the 10 players, a pre-determined <br> number of them are imposters. The crewmates have to <br> identify and eject the imposters, before the imposters <br> can kill the crew. It's a game based on deception and <br> investigation, where you can't trust anyone. When <br> playing with nine other friends, this game has given <br> me some of the best laughs and shocks I've ever had. <br> <br> The main issues with the game are solely down to the <br> actions of others, with players leaving if they don't get <br> to be the imposter or cheating in order to win. <br> Innersloth have tackled this issue, with players being <br> banned for 3 hours if they leave the game on purpose. <br> <br>  The game doesn't have a soundtrack, but it does <br> include various sound-effects. <br> <br> On the whole, I would give "Among Us" an 8/10.</p>

                <p>Upon it's initial releaseback in 2016, "No Man's Sky" <br> was a project with so much potential that <br> unfortunately failed to live up to the hype. The game <br> got stale fairly quickly and parts of the game just <br> didn't work. But rather than give up on what many <br> would deem to be a failed project, the team at Hello <br> Games put in the time and the effort in order to fix <br> their game. Multiple updates later, the game is now <br> much closer to that of what was promised originally. <br><br> Despite the major step up from it's initial release, the <br> game isn't perfect. Playing with friends drastically <br> improves the experience; playing alone unfortunately <br> gets boring fairly quickly. The scanner also sometimes <br> doesn't work, as it detects objects and creatures that <br> aren't actually present <br> <br> The soundtrack is fairly standard - nothing particularly <br> special.

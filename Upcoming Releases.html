    <h1>Returnal</h1>
    <p class="upcoming_size">Returnal is a PlayStation 5 exclusive from Resogun developer Housemarque that seems to be going too far under the radar right now. This 2021 title is looking particularly impressive in both footage and screenshots, and today we've gotten even more of the latter combined with some new details. These tidbits come courtesy of the game's official PS5 page, where the roguelike is described as one "designed for extreme replayability".</p>
